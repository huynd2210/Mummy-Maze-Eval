      "content": "Let's analyze the grid and the situation:\n\nGrid representation (double-resolution, but we can interpret the characters):\n\n- 'P' is the player (explorer).\n- 'E' is the exit.\n- 'W' is a white mummy.\n- There are also gates (represented by '|' and '-' and '+' at intersections) and walls.\n- 'K' is a key.\n- There are traps (represented by '=').\n\nFrom the grid:\n- The player is at the bottom left (row 11, column 2? Actually, let's count rows and columns).\n\nBut to avoid confusion, let's look at the immediate surroundings of the player:\n\nThe row with the player: \"|P.......E..|\" - so player is at the left, exit is at the right.\n\nThere are two white mummies (W) above the player.\n\nAlso, there is a key (K) in the middle.\n\nNow, the enemies: white mummies move first horizontally then vertically. They are above the player.\n\nIf the player moves right, they might get closer to the exit, but the mummies will move toward the player.\n\nLet's see the possible moves:\n\nThe player can move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nBut LEFT is probably a wall? The grid has walls.\n\nActually, the grid is bounded by walls.\n\nLooking at the player's position: in the row \"|P.......E..|\", the player is at the first cell after the left wall. So left is wall, right is open.\n\nAbove the player: the row above is \"|.|...+--.|.|\" which has gates and walls.\n\nBut to reach the exit, the player needs to go right.\n\nHowever, there are mummies above.\n\nAlso, there is a key at the top middle. Stepping on the key toggles gates.\n\nBut currently, the gates are closed? We need to see.\n\nBut for immediate safety: the white mummies are at positions: one in \"|.|K...W|W..|\" - so two W's: one at column 7 and one at column 9 (approx).\n\nAnd the player is at row 11, column 2.\n\nSo the mummies are 4 rows above and 5-7 columns to the right.\n\nThey will move toward the player: first horizontally (to get same column) then vertically.\n\nSo they will move left and down.\n\nThe player should move right toward the exit.\n\nBut there is a trap? The grid has traps represented by '='. In the row \"|.+=+.+--.+-+\" there are traps.\n\nBut the player is below that.\n\nSo for now, moving right is safe.\n\nLet's simulate one step:\n\nIf player moves RIGHT, to (11,3).\n\nThen mummies move:\n\nWhite mummy at (5,7): wants to get to same column as player (column 3). So it moves left 2 steps? It can move up to 2 squares per turn.\n\nCurrent player at (11,3).\n\nMummy at (5,7): horizontal difference: 4 to left. So it can move left 2, to (5,5).\n\nSimilarly, mummy at (5,9): horizontal difference 6 to left. Move left 2 to (5,7).\n\nThen next turn, they will move further.\n\nSo player should continue right.\n\nBut there is a key at (5,3) approx? In row \"|.|K...W|W..|\", K is at column 3.\n\nIf player goes right, they might not get the key, but it's not necessary unless to open gates.\n\nBut the exit is open? The exit is at (11,10) approx.\n\nSo player can go right without the key.\n\nBut to be safe, we should move right.\n\nSo action: RIGHT.\n\nTherefore, the response is:\nAction: RIGHT",

      "content": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\n- The grid is given in a double-resolution format, meaning each character represents a half-cell. I need to interpret the actual grid.\n\n- The player is represented by 'P'. From the string: \"..P.....E..\" likely means there is a 'P' and an 'E' (which might be an enemy or exit? But note: the grid has \"W\" for white mummy and \"E\" for red mummy? Actually, the legend isn't fully given, but from context.\n\nLooking at the grid string:\n\n+-----------+\n|...........|\n+--.....---.|\n|...........|\n|.|.---.+--.|\n|.|W....|...|\n|.+-+...|...|\n|...|..W....|\n|.|.|.+--.+-+\n|.|...|...|.|\n|.|...+--.|.|\n|..P.....E..|\n+-----------+\n\nI need to parse this to understand the layout. It seems to be a grid of 11x11? Actually, the double-resolution means each character is half a cell, so the actual maze has half the resolution.\n\nBut to understand the immediate situation:\n\n- The player is at the position of 'P'. From the string: \"..P.....E..\" is part of the last row.\n\n- There is an 'E' which is likely the red mummy (since white is 'W' and red is 'E'? But note: the grid has \"W\" and \"E\" as mummies.\n\n- Also, there is a scorpion? But not shown in the string.\n\nBut the main point: the player is at a position, and there is an enemy 'E' nearby.\n\nNow, the rules: \n- Player moves first.\n- Then enemies move.\n\nIf an enemy lands on the player, we lose.\n\nSo, what should the player do?\n\nLooking at the immediate vicinity:\n\nThe player is at the position of 'P'. The string \"..P.....E..\" suggests that to the right of P, there is an 'E' (red mummy) at distance.\n\nIf the player moves RIGHT, they would move into the same cell as the 'E'? But wait, the grid is double-resolution, so each character is half-cell. So the actual grid has cells that are 2 characters wide.\n\nActually, the grid is represented with characters that are half-cells. So each cell is represented by 2 characters horizontally and 2 vertically? Actually, the double-resolution means that each \"cell\" is represented by 4 characters (2x2) in the string.\n\nBut to simplify, I should think in terms of actual grid cells.\n\nFrom the string, the last row is \"..P.....E..\", which means:\n\n- The row has 11 characters? Actually, the grid is 11 cells wide? But each character is half a cell.\n\nActually, the grid is 11x11? But the double-resolution means each cell is represented by 2x2 characters.\n\nBut for movement, we care about which cell the player is in.\n\nThe cell that contains 'P' is likely at a certain position.\n\nBut to avoid the enemy, we need to see what happens if we move.\n\nIf the player moves RIGHT, they would move to the adjacent cell. But the string \"..P.....E..\" suggests that the cell to the right of P has an 'E' in it? Actually, the 'E' is in a different cell.\n\nActually, the string \"..P.....E..\" is for one row. The 'P' is at position, and 'E' is at another.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, I should consider the immediate danger.\n\nThe enemy 'E' (red mummy) is in the same row as the player, a few cells away.\n\nNow, the movement rules for red mummy: \"moves up to 2 squares per turn. Prioritizes moving vertically toward you if possible, otherwise horizontally.\"\n\nSo, if the player does nothing, the red mummy will move towards the player.\n\nIf the player moves away, it might be safe.\n\nBut if the player moves right, they might move into the cell with the 'E'? Actually, the 'E' is in a different cell.\n\nBut let's think: the grid has cells. The string \"..P.....E..\" means that the cell containing 'P' and the cell containing 'E' are adjacent? Not necessarily.\n\nActually, the string is a row of the grid, with characters representing half-cells.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should look for the exit or other features.\n\nBut the instruction is to respond with an action.\n\nGiven that there is an enemy nearby, moving away might be safe.\n\nBut also, there is a 'W' (white mummy) in the grid, which might be moving.\n\nBut to start, I should move the player away from the 'E'.\n\nSo, which direction",
